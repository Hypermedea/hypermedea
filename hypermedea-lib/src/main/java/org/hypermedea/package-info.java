/**
 * <p>
 *   Main <b>Hypermedea</b> package (includes artifacts to be used by hypermedia agents).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Hypermedea is a collection of utilities to build hypermedia agents with the
 *   <a href="http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/">JaCaMo framework</a>, a multi-agent oriented
 *   programming framework.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Each Hypermedea utility is provided as a <b>CArtAgO artifact</b>, i.e. a Java class that
 *   exposes attributes and methods to agents (respectively called <em>observable properties</em>
 *   and <em>operations</em> in the CArtAgo terminology). See the Javadoc of individual artifact
 *   classes for more information.
