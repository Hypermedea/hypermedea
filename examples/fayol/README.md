# Fayol Knowledge Graph

In this example, the `spider` agent crawls a Knowledge Graph (KG)
describing the building hosting the Henri Fayol institute of
Mines Saint-Ã‰tienne.

This example can be executed with the Hypermedea executable:
```shell
<HYPERMEDEA_FOLDER>/bin/hypermedea fayol.jcm
```
Every run of the example will be logged in the `/log` folder.

If you haven't downloaded Hypermedea, the example can also be run with Gradle (v8.2.1 or higher):
```shell
gradle run
```
